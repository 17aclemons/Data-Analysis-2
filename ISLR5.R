#Question 1) What is the probability that a bootstrap sample contains a given observation? Explain in precise detail, with math, in your own words.
# there is a 1/n (with n being the number of observations) that a given observation is in a sample. Similar to rolling a dice,
# getting a specific number is 1/6.
